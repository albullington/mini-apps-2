#mini-apps-2
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project involved building: 

1. A real-time cryptocurrency graph using the CoinDesk API. 
2. A checkout form for an e-commerce website using React and React Router. 
3. Minesweeper using React and Redux. 
4. An app to search for historical events using React Paginate and a simple JSON server.
